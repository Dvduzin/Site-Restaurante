# Restaurant Website
Website created during my studies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It contains a landing page, a small menu, and a contact form that redirects the user to another page.

The website was made for a fictional restaurant called: Daniel's Dapper Dutch.

The theme of the fictional restaurant is the Netherlands.
